Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems. Customers aren’t looking for another hero; they’re looking for a guide.

This is a sale or pricing section in which you list down what your customers will get and putting a \"BUY NOW\" button at the end. Most customers really want to see what’s on the product before buying so this section is beneficial to your homepage. Moreover, you can see that we scatter CTA buttons all over the landing page so that when a customer decides to buy a product, they don’t have to search for it.\n\nThe final section is the junk section.

Navigational Search Intent\nNavigational intent means that the user wants to find a specific page. Unlike with other intent types, searchers already know what they’re trying to find.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with navigational intent: \n\nstarbucks\ngmail login\nsemrush keyword magic tool\nikea refund policy\nAs you can see, navigational keywords are often branded. They're all about ensuring that your target audience can find your pages easily when they need to find them.\n\n2. Informational Search Intent\nInformational search intent means that the user wants to learn something. These searches are often phrased as questions and use words like who, what, where, why, and how.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with informational intent: \n\nbruce willis movies\nwhat is seo\ncalifornia time now\nhow to clean a dishwasher\nGoogle will often answer the more specific questions directly in the SERP:\n\nhow old is bono serp\nBut for most informational queries, the No. 1 content type is still a blog post. That's why blogging likely needs to be part of your SEO strategy. \n\nHere are the top benefits of targeting informational keywords:\n\nVisibility: Informational queries make up a significant number of searches in Google. If you want visibility, you can’t ignore them. \nBuilding trust: Providing useful information andeducating your audience is a great way to build trust in your expertise\nTargeting new leads: Content that targets informational keywords can bring in new leads you can convert later\nAlthough ranking for informational queries probably won't bring you tons of direct conversions, it can still be a valuable opportunity to grow your business.\n\n3. Commercial Search Intent\nCommercial search intent includes keywords your audience uses when they’re doing their research before a purchase.\n\nThe commercial intent lies somewhere between informational and transactional intent. The user is looking for information, but the information is closely connected to the action.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with commercial intent: \n\nbest indoor plants for low light\napple watch ultra review\nmailchimp alternatives\nhbo max vs netflix\nThe search results for commercial queries often include third-party pages with independent reviews of the products. That's why it can be very hard (even impossible) to rank for some commercial keywords relevant to your brand. \n\nLuckily, there are marketing strategies (as well as tools, like Semrush’s Surround Sound) that can help you stay visible in the decision-making process of your potential customers. \n\n4. Transactional Search Intent\nTransactional search intent means users want to do something specific, often an action you might want them to do as a business owner.\n\nDespite what the name implies, this isn’t restricted just to purchases. For example, a user doing a transactional search might want to complete a newsletter signup or download software.\n\nHere are some examples of keywords with transactional intent: \n\niphone 13 pro max price\npersonality test online\nsemrush trial\nwatch friends\nTransactional keywords are your money-makers. These are the keywords your future customers use when they’re ready to convert.  \nNote: Keywords classified as \"Transactional\" reflect a search intent to purchase or enroll in a program or school, while \"Informational\" keywords reflect a search for information about the topic.\n\nPlease show the results in a table and classify them based on the category.\n\n[PROMPT]", "is_active": true, "created": "2023-02-15T15:15:15.541Z", "updated": "2023-02-15T15:15:15.541Z"}}, {"model": "core.prompt", "pk": 1190, "fields": {"title": "Product Related SEO Information(All)", "sub_topic": 10, "content": "Description, Details, FAQ, Genre, Themes, Conclusion,11 SEO Keyphrases, Meta Description, SEO Title, 15 tags.

He's also incredibly smart, having a \"brain the size of a planet\" capable of computing extremely complex mathematics, as well as solving difficult problems and operating high-tech devices.\n\nHowever, despite being so smart, Marvin is typically made to perform menial tasks and labour such as escorting people, opening doors, picking up pieces of paper, and other tasks well beneath his skills. Even extremely hard tasks, such as computing for the vast Krikkit robot army, are trivial for Marvin. All this leaves him extremely bored, frustrated, and overwhelmingly depressed. Because of this, all modern GPP-capable machines, such as Eddie the computer and the Heart of Gold's automatic doors, are programmed to be extremely cheerful and happy, much to Marvin's disgust.\n\n\nArthur Dent and Marvin on Magrathea, as seen in the 1981 TV series.\n\nMarvin hates everyone and everything he comes into contact with, having no respect for anybody and will criticise and insult others at any opportunity, or otherwise rant and complain for hours on end about his own problems, such as the terrible pain he suffers in all the diodes down his left side. His contempt for everyone is often justified, as almost every person he comes across, even those who consider him a friend, (such as Arthur and Trillian, who treat him more kindly than Ford and Zaphod) treat Marvin as an expendable servant, even sending him to his death more than once (such as when Zaphod ordered Marvin to fight the gigantic, heavy-duty Frogstar Scout Robot Class D so he could escape). Being a robot, he still does what he's told (he won't enjoy it, nor will he let you forget it, but he'll do it anyway), though he'd much rather sulk in a corner by himself.\n\nSeveral times in the series Marvin ends up alone and isolated for extremely long periods of time, sometimes spanning millions of years, either by sheer bad luck (such as the explosion that propelled everyone but Marvin to Milliways in the far-off future) or because his unpleasantly depressing personality drives them away or, in more than one case, makes them commit suicide. In his spare time (which he has a lot of), Marvin will attempt to occupy himself by composing songs and writing poetry. Of course, none of them are particularly cheerful, or even that good.\"\n\nFunction or class to comment on in [TARGETLANGUAGE]:\n[PROMPT]", "is_active": true, "created": "2023-02-15T15:15:17.818Z", "updated": "2023-02-15T15:15:17.818Z"}}, {"model": "core.prompt", "pk": 1450, "fields": {"title": "Target audiences with partnerships", "sub_topic": 64, "content": "Find partners that can help your brand reach your audiences", "placeholder": "Name your brand (e.g. “Fabric London”) + SHIFT ENTER + Name your category in simple but precise language.
